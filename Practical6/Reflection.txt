Was it easy or hard?
Some parts were easy, and some were hard.
Setting up the initial parameters and plotting was easy; 
but the spatial modeling infection spread and recovery was hard.

Which parts did you enjoy more or less?
I enjoyed seeing the spatial SIR model visualized with disease spreading, it's so interesting;
But I met much trouble when coloring the vaccination spacial model, because the defalt color was hard to tell between 2 and 3, making me thought my code was wrong but actually it was just the unclear colors.

What was the most important thing you learned?
I learned how to modelling infections for visulization, which is helpful for predicting and controlling some infections.
