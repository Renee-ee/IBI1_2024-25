How has the relationship between the DALYs in China and the UK changed over time?
Are they becoming more similar, less similar?

Code line number where start answering: 84

Discussion:
The plotted trends show that DALYs in both China and the UK have generally declined over time.
The absolute difference between their DALYs has also decreased, especially after the year 2000.

This suggests that the two countries are becoming more similar in terms of total health burden.
Possible reasons may include China's improving healthcare system, increased life expectancy, and better disease prevention measures narrowing the gap with the UK.
