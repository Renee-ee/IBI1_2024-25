#4.1 Some simple math 
a=15 #The walk to the bus stop is 15 mins
b=1*60+15 #The bus journey takes 1 hr and 15 mins
c=a+b #the total length of time

d=1*60+30 #The drive takes 1 hr and 30 mins
e=5  #the walk from the car park takes 5 mins
f=d+e #the total length of time for the car-based commute
# compare c to f: f is longer
# c(walk to the bus stop and take the bus directly to their office) is quicker


#4.2 Booleans
X = True
Y = False
W = X and Y #a new variable called W which encodes the Boolean variable ‘both X and Y’
# W is False
